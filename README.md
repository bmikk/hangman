Welcome to Hangman!

The game is played following the standard rules, with the option to save your game or load from a save file.

The computer chooses a random word, and the player will guess letters, which will fill in the blank slots if correct. After 6 incorrect letter guesses, the player loses.

Each turn, the player has the option to attempt to guess the full word, guess a new letter, save the game, or exit. 

Good luck!
